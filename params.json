{"name":"CheatsandTrix-Redshift","tagline":"Some insights, cheats and tricks for working with AWS Redshift that helped me","body":"### Welcome to my AWS Redshift Cheats, Tricks and Tips:\r\nThis page is mostly for my own reference, compiled from notes, hacking sessions and other learnings on AWS Redshift. I love using Redshift, and if you have the need for a data warehouse with a lot more flexibility, optimized performance and query ability, check out Redshift. You'll be glad you did!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n1 Use SSE - S3 will handle for you. If using Client-side, use the COPY command to load data - it decrypts during copy.\r\n2 Connect string - On the SQL client I've not had problems with the \"jdbc\" prefix, but SSL is available (details [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com//redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-ssl-support.html#connecting-ssl-support-java) )\r\n3 ACL - All set up in IAM\r\n4 Credentials - Connecting to a server uses your access and secret keys. Connecting via a sql client uses your masteruser credentials (Ideally create a non-masteruser user) that you set up when launching the cluster.\r\n5 Encryption - Encryption on the database on user tables is setup at launch time\r\n6 Security groups - Confusing. Cluster-security groups in ec2-classic; VPC in non ec2-classic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
